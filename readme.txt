This is a Matlab library for detecting and approximation decision lines/faults in 2D and 3D. We describe the underlying algorithm in
"Detecting and approximating decision boundaries in low dimensional spaces", which is availabe at arXiv.org.

This library requires the Matlab library mesh2D by Darren Engwirda (https://github.com/dengwirda/mesh2d).
