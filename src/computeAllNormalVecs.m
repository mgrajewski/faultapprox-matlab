% This function computes the approximate normals for th set of triplets
% given by PointsIclass and PointsJclass, respectively. The normals are
% based on local linearization in compueNormalVec and point to jclass.
%
% Input:
% - PointsIclass, PointsJclass: set of triplets
% - FaultApproxParams: structure containing all parameters relevant for
%   the algorithm. We refer to FaultApproxParameters.m for details.
%
% Output:
% - NormalsSurface: approximate normal vector for each triplet
